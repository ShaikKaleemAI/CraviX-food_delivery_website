/* Cancellation is a single shared clock deadline for the whole day:
   closing time + extra/grace time + the admin's cancellation allowance,
   all added together. E.g. closing 7:30 PM + 3 min grace + 10 min
   cancellation allowance = every order placed that day can be cancelled
   up until 7:43 PM, full stop — not "10 minutes after I personally
   placed it".

   This is always computed from the CURRENT live settings (not a value
   frozen on the order at creation time) — if the admin changes the
   closing time (or grace/allowance/mode) mid-day, every still-open
   order's cancellation deadline moves with it immediately, both for the
   customer-facing countdown/terms text and for this endpoint's own
   enforcement. The closingTime/graceMinutes/etc fields still stored on
   each order are kept only as a historical record of what was in effect
   when it was placed — they are no longer used to compute the deadline.

   Two admin-selectable ways to decide the cancellation deadline:
   - "afterClosing" (default): a single shared clock deadline for the
     whole day — closing time + grace + the admin's cancellation
     allowance. Open from the moment the order is placed.
   - "timeRange": cancellation is only allowed inside a fixed daily
     clock-time window (e.g. 6:00 PM – 7:00 PM), independent of the
     closing time. Orders placed before the window opens must wait;
     once it closes, cancellation is locked out for the rest of the day.

   dateKey is an IST calendar date ("YYYY-MM-DD"), taken from the order
   itself (so the window still applies to the day the order was actually
   placed on); the various *Time fields are IST clock times ("HH:MM")
   read live from settings. Combining them with an explicit +05:30 offset
   gives an unambiguous instant regardless of the server's own timezone. */

/* Self-healing pool recalculation — and the single source of truth for
   every order's status. Rather than trusting an incrementally maintained
   running total or a "once true, always true" met flag (which is what
   caused orders to stay stuck showing "Confirmed" after a cancellation
   dragged the day's real total back below the minimum), this recomputes
   the day's pool total FROM THE ORDERS THEMSELVES every time it's
   called, decides met/not-met fresh each time, and then moves orders
   BOTH directions to match:
     - met AND still "held"      -> sweep up to "confirmed"
     - not met AND still "confirmed" (not yet "preparing")
                                  -> sweep back down to "held"
   Orders already "preparing" or "delivered" are never touched — once the
   kitchen has actually started on a specific order, a later cancellation
   elsewhere shouldn't erase that. Only orders still sitting at
   "confirmed" (i.e. the kitchen hasn't started them yet) are eligible to
   fall back to pending if the batch that justified confirming them no
   longer holds up.
   Safe to call as often as needed — on every order placed, every
   cancellation, and defensively on every pool-status read.

   NOT called directly — see reconcilePool() below, which wraps this in a
   short cache. Every route that actually CHANGES orders for a dateKey
   invalidates that cache right before calling reconcilePool(), so this
   uncached version still always runs (and the result is always fresh)
   immediately after a real order placement/cancellation/edit/admin action —
   caching only ever collapses repeated READ-triggered calls (polling,
   self-heal on GET /mine and GET /, the background heartbeat). */
